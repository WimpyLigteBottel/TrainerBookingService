# TrainerBookingService
The goal of this repo is to build basic backend + frontend to do simple trainer bookings



# Goal of the service?

Scenario
During the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, physical exercise was very difficult, especially during lock-down. Getting to the gym was not possible and still remains difficult.
We want you to design a booking page for the Online Personal Trainer as well as a RESTful API to support that. The idea is that the gym or trainer would have a website where clients could go and see what classes are available and book a slot. Yes, there may be fees and invoicing as part of signing up for a service like this, but don’t worry about that. Focus on how to present the classes on offer and how to book a class as easily as possible.
Consider:
- How many trainers are there at the gym?
- How to present all the classes and book simply?
- Filter types of classes?
- Filter specific trainers?
- Do you need a date calendar selector?
- How far in advance can you book a class?
- When are trainers available?

These considerations are listed to give you a better idea of what is required. Perhaps one of these considerations don’t align with your design; just give a short comment in the Readme file as to why.
